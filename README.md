We ASteroids are visualizing Earth through NASA's lenses, we aim to study the
completed projects of NASA focusing on Earth and it's attributes.
We are focusing on the major issue “Ozone layer depletion”
Nasa launched it’s 6 satellites starting from the year 1991 to the recent 2004
for studying the ozone hole in the atmosphere.
Our motive is to mapping out the collected data for different satellites and
comparing their factors and quantities.
Below mention are its satellites, broadly focusing on atmosphere ,and noting
the changes of Ozone layer.
1. Aura
2. NOAA-N Prime
3. Van Allen Probes/Radiation Belt Storm Probes
4. TDRS
5. TOMS-EP
6. Upper Atmosphere Radiation Satellite (UARS)
7. Nimbus-4
8. Echo1A
9. Echo2
10.TOMS-EP
11.ADEOS I
12.NOAA-9
13.NOAA-11
14.Cosmos45
15.Cosmos92

We have collected the data ,below attached are few samples of our work, still
a lot more comparison needs to be done using Tableau.
We will be studying and will plot the required changing factors in
atmosphere(specifically ozone layer).
